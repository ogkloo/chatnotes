# Chat Notes

A lot of people write their notes in a personal Discord server or whatever. We think this practice is kind of bad for obvious reasons (privacy, access, etc) but it's also good because Discord has a lot of organizational features (channels, threads, easy media, etc) that it'd be cool to have in a notes app.

We reword notes as messages in channels or threads or whatever.

Also I like wasm lmao
